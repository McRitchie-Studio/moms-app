# BEHAVIORAL guard for the local log cap.
#
# This app DOES carry studio-engine, but the lock resolves 0.32.1 and the
# `studio.logger` initializer that caps every consuming app only arrived in
# 0.33.0 — so nothing caps these logs today. That bump is its own change and
# already has its own PR (dependabot #28, 0.32.1 -> 0.74.11, 18 gems), so the
# cap lives in config/environments/{development,test}.rb for now. When the bump
# lands, the engine sets the SAME two values from a later initializer and this
# file keeps passing — which is exactly why each case asserts the booted VALUE
# rather than who set it.
#
# THE ASSERTION IS THE PROPERTY, NOT THE SPELLING. A grep for `log_file_size`
# keeps passing after someone moves the line somewhere Rails reads too late,
# and "too late" is easy to hit: Rails' `:initialize_logger` is a BOOTSTRAP
# initializer, so a cap set from a railtie or engine initializer never applies
# and every command still exits 0. Environment files load before it, which is
# why setting it there works. So each case reads the cap off a logger that was
# actually built.
